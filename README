This is a small app written to provide a poll similar to those on political 
debates for a podcast I listen to, NSFWShow (http://twit.tv/nsfw).
It was written using Node.JS and Redis.

I have included both a version written in Javascript, and a version that 
was created using CoffeeScript. This was my first attempt at 
CoffeeScript, so it may not be all correct.

Required modules:
express
redis
ejs
stylus
